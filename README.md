<h1>Zero-Inflated Poisson - Model Validation Method Comparison</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
There is very little literature regarding creation and validation of zero-inflated poisson models using R. In light of this, I worked with Dr. Swarnali Banerjee (Loyola University Chicago head of Data Science Program) to begin an exploration of the topic. This project contains a coding pipeline I created to compare k-fold Cross Validation with stratified k-fold CV of ZIP models.
